        "#Functions\n",
        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  In Python, functions and methods are both blocks of reusable code, but they differ in their context and usage.\n",
        "  - A function is a standalone block of code defined using the def keyword.\n",
        "  -It is not tied to any specific object and can be called independently.\n",
        "  - Functions are used to perform a specific task and can take arguments and return values.\n",
        " -A method is a function that is associated with an object (usually part of a class).\n",
        "  -It operates on the data (attributes) of the object it is called on.\n",
        "  -Methods are typically used to define behaviors of an object and often require the self parameter to access the object's attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "  Parameters:\n",
        "  -These are the placeholders or variables defined in the function's definition.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -They act as \"input slots\" for the function, allowing it to accept data when called.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Argument:\n",
        "\n",
        "   -In Python, arguments are values that are passed to functions when they are called. These values are used by the function to perform operations or calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "   -Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses, and can be of various types, such as positional, keyword, default, and arbitrary arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?  \n",
        "\n",
        "  -In Python, a function is defined using the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses. The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "  -Send a Result Back to the Caller.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -End Function Execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Enable Reusability and Modularity>\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "  -Iterable: Think of it as a \"collection\" you can loop through.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Iterator: Think of it as the \"mechanism\" that enables looping, one item at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -Generators in Python are a powerful tool that allows you to create iterators in a more memory-efficient way. They are particularly useful when working with large datasets or streams of data, as they generate values on the fly and do not store the entire sequence in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -In Python, generators are defined using functions that include the yield keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -A generator function has one or more yield functions, whereas a normal function has only one function.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -The states of local variables are retained between calls.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "\n",
        " -A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword. Unlike regular functions defined with def, lambda functions are single-expression functions that return their result implicitly. They are often used for short, simple operations where defining a full function might feel excessive.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        " -The map function in Python applies a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list or tuple) and returns a map object (which is an iterator).\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -The map() function applies a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list) and returns a map object (an iterator).\n",
        "\n",
        "  -The reduce() function applies a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, to reduce the iterable to a single value.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -The filter() function constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true.\n",
        "\n",
